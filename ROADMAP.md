## üöÄ Upcoming Features

### v0.3.0 - Symbol-Level Incremental Indexing
**Target**: Q2 2025

**Goals**:
- Fine-grained change detection at function/class level
- Only re-embed modified symbols within a file
- Further reduce embedding costs by 50-70%
- Smart diff-based chunk invalidation

**Technical Details**:
- Extend hash-cache.ts to track symbol-level changes
- AST-based symbol extraction and comparison
- Chunk-to-symbol mapping for precise invalidation
- Incremental vector database updates (upsert changed chunks only)

**Benefits**:
- Even faster reindexing for large files with small changes
- More efficient for projects with large modules
- Better tracking of refactoring operations

---

### v0.3.1 - Embedding Model Optimization
**Target**: Q2 2025

**Goals**:
- Local embedding model support (sentence-transformers, instructor-xl)
- Embedding model switching without full reindex
- Multi-model support for different file types
- Quantized model support for faster inference

**Features**:
- Built-in FAISS integration for local vector search
- Automatic model dimension compatibility checking
- Migration tools for switching embedding models
- Benchmark suite for model comparison

---

### v0.4.0 - Smart Caching Layer
**Target**: Q3 2025

**Goals**:
- Persistent embedding cache across projects
- Content-addressable storage for duplicate code detection
- Cross-project chunk deduplication
- Automatic cache pruning and optimization

**Technical Details**:
- Global cache directory (~/.context/embedding-cache/)
- Content hash ‚Üí embedding vector mapping
- LRU eviction for cache size management
- Configurable cache size limits

**Benefits**:
- Zero-cost embedding for duplicated code patterns
- Faster initial indexing for similar projects
- Reduced API costs for common libraries

---

### v0.4.1 - Advanced Query Features
**Target**: Q3 2025

**Goals**:
- Semantic code search with natural language queries
- Cross-file reference tracking and navigation
- Code similarity detection and clustering
- Advanced filtering (by author, date, commit, etc.)

**Features**:
- Graph-based code relationship visualization
- "Find similar code" functionality
- Git history integration for temporal queries
- Custom query language for complex searches

---

### v0.5.0 - Performance & Scalability
**Target**: Q4 2025

**Goals**:
- Parallel processing for multi-core systems
- Streaming indexing for very large projects
- Memory-efficient chunking strategies
- Distributed indexing support

**Technical Details**:
- Worker pool for concurrent file processing
- Streaming AST parsing for reduced memory usage
- Sharded vector collections for massive codebases
- Progress persistence for resumable indexing

**Targets**:
- Index 1M+ LOC in under 10 minutes
- Support projects with 100K+ files
- Memory usage under 500MB during indexing

---

### v0.5.1 - Developer Experience
**Target**: Q4 2025

**Goals**:
- IDE plugins (VS Code, JetBrains, Neovim)
- Git pre-commit hooks for automatic indexing
- CI/CD integration examples
- Comprehensive API documentation

**Features**:
- One-click indexing from IDE
- Real-time incremental updates on file save
- GitHub Actions workflow templates
- Python/TypeScript SDK for custom integrations

---

## üîÆ Future Considerations

### Research & Exploration
These features are under consideration but not yet scheduled:

- **Multi-modal Support**: Index documentation, diagrams, and screenshots
- **Code Graph Analysis**: Dependency analysis and impact assessment
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Automatic code quality metrics and suggestions
- **Collaborative Features**: Shared indexes for team environments
- **Privacy Features**: Encrypted embeddings and on-premise deployment
- **Language Server Protocol**: Direct LSP integration for better IDE support

## üìä Performance Goals

### Indexing Speed
- **Current**: ~1000 files/minute (with embedding API)
- **v0.3.x**: ~2000 files/minute (symbol-level incremental)
- **v0.5.x**: ~5000 files/minute (parallel processing)

### Cost Reduction
- **Current**: 90%+ savings with file-level incremental
- **v0.3.x**: 95%+ savings with symbol-level incremental
- **v0.4.x**: 98%+ savings with smart caching
